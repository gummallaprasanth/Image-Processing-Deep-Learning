# Image Processing Guide: Converting RGB to Grayscale

This project is mainly focuse on image processing , how to read an image file, convert it into a NumPy array, resize the image, and convert an RGB image to Grayscale using three popular libraries: Pillow, Matplotlib, and OpenCV.

## libraries that used in the project

Pillow

Matplotlib

OpenCV


## Steps in the process

1.Get  the image from the internet using weg get method 

2.covert the image into numpy array using matplot.iamge library

3.reszing the image using pillow  libraray method

4.converting the image from RGB to grayscale using opencv library method 

## Summary
Reading an Image: Use Pillow, Matplotlib, or OpenCV to load an image into a NumPy array.

Resizing an Image: You can resize images using Pillow's resize method or OpenCV's resize function.

RGB to Grayscale Conversion: Convert RGB images to Grayscale using the  cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY in OpenCV.
